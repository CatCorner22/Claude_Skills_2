description: >-
  Writes, reviews, and optimizes analytical SQL — joins, GROUP BY aggregation, window functions,
  CTEs, subqueries, and date/time handling — with a working sense of performance (grain,
  sargability, indexing). Delivers the query as a package: a grain comment on top, the
  CTE-layered query, stated row-count/known-total validation, and dialect caveats. Use when
  turning a business question into a query for a report or
  analysis, adding window logic like running totals or rankings, or reviewing a query for
  correctness and speed. Triggers: SQL, query, write a query, join, GROUP BY, aggregate, window
  function, OVER clause, PARTITION BY, running total, moving average, rank, lag, lead, CTE, subquery,
  QUALIFY, slow query, optimize query, group by grain.

# SQL for analysts

## When to use
- Translating a business question into an analytical query (aggregations, trends, rankings, cohorts) against a warehouse or database.
- Adding window functions (running totals, moving averages, rank, period-over-period) or restructuring a query with CTEs.
- Reviewing a query for correctness (grain, join fan-out, filter placement) or making a slow one faster.
- Not for: deciding whether a platform's governed reporting layer (semantic model, subject areas)
  should replace hand-written SQL → a platform policy call; record yours in
  `references/your-environment.md`. For profiling a dataset before you query it → see
  `data-analytics-bi-skills:exploratory-data-analysis`.

## Do it
1. **State the grain of the answer first.** Write down what one output row represents (one
   customer-month, one order, one product). Those grain columns *are* your `GROUP BY`. A wrong grain
   is the number-one cause of wrong numbers.
2. **Reason in logical query order, not top-to-bottom.** SQL evaluates `FROM/JOIN → WHERE → GROUP BY
   → HAVING → window functions → SELECT → QUALIFY → ORDER BY → LIMIT`. This is why a `SELECT` alias
   can't be used in `WHERE`, and why a window function can't sit in `WHERE`.
3. **Pick the join type deliberately.** `INNER` drops non-matches; `LEFT` keeps every left row.
   Watch for many-to-many joins that fan out and multiply rows — they silently inflate every `SUM`
   and `COUNT`. Compare row counts before and after each join to catch it.
4. **Aggregate vs. window — choose by output shape.** Use `GROUP BY` when you want *fewer* rows (one
   per group). Use a window (`OVER (PARTITION BY … ORDER BY …)`) when you want a per-group
   calculation but keep *every* row: running totals with `SUM(...) OVER`, ranking with
   `ROW_NUMBER/RANK/DENSE_RANK`, period comparisons with `LAG/LEAD`.
5. **Filter in the right clause.** `WHERE` filters raw rows before grouping (fast, index-friendly).
   `HAVING` filters after aggregation, on aggregates. `QUALIFY` (Snowflake/BigQuery/Databricks)
   filters on window results — e.g. keep the latest row per key with
   `QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY ts DESC) = 1`. On dialects without `QUALIFY`,
   wrap the window in a CTE and filter outside it.
6. **Layer with CTEs for readability.** Break a gnarly query into named `WITH` steps (stage →
   aggregate → join → final). Prefer CTEs over deeply nested subqueries for anything you'd re-read.
7. **Handle dates as half-open ranges.** Filter with `ts >= '2026-01-01' AND ts < '2026-02-01'`
   rather than `WHERE FUNC(ts) = …`; bucket with `DATE_TRUNC`; be explicit about time zone. This
   both avoids boundary bugs and stays sargable (next step).
8. **Sanity-check, then tune.** Validate row counts and one or two known totals against a trusted
   source. For speed: keep predicates **sargable** (compare the bare column, not `WHERE UPPER(col)=…`),
   filter early, select only needed columns, and ensure join/filter keys are indexed or clustered.
   See `references/query-patterns.md` for copy-ready patterns and dialect notes.
9. **Deliver the query as a package, not bare SQL.** The finished deliverable contains: a one-line
   grain comment on top (`-- grain: one row per customer-month`); the CTE-layered query; the
   validation evidence from step 8, stated rather than just performed ("row count 1,204 matches
   the source; June total ties to the dashboard"); and caveats (dialect substitutions, time zone,
   any accepted fan-out). The assistant drafts the query and runs the checks; the human owns the
   metric's business definition and names the trusted source to tie against.

## Why / learn
The core shift is to **think in sets, not row-by-row loops**. SQL is declarative: you describe the
shape of the result and the engine figures out how to build it, so your job is to get two things
right — the **grain** (what one row means) and the **predicates** (which rows and which clause).
Grain drives correctness: a join that fans out to a finer grain than your `GROUP BY` expects will
double-count, and no amount of tuning fixes a query that's answering the wrong question. Predicates
drive both correctness and speed — `WHERE` runs before aggregation on raw rows, `HAVING` after, and
window functions in between, which is the whole reason the logical order matters. Aggregation and
windows are the same idea (compute over a group) with a different output contract: collapse to one
row, or annotate every row. Sargability is just the physical echo of the same principle — when you
leave a column bare on one side of a comparison, the engine can seek an index or partition instead of
scanning everything. Master grain, clause placement, and set thinking, and every dialect's syntax
becomes a detail.

## Common mistakes
- Not fixing the grain first → double-counted `SUM`s from a fan-out join. Decide what one row means, then join to it.
- `SELECT *` with `GROUP BY` a few columns → wrong or non-deterministic results. Group by exactly the grain; aggregate the rest.
- Putting a window function in `WHERE` → error or wrong logic. Filter windows with `QUALIFY` or a wrapping CTE.
- Mixing up `WHERE` and `HAVING` → `WHERE` is pre-aggregation on rows, `HAVING` is post-aggregation on aggregates.
- Wrapping the filtered column in a function (`WHERE DATE(ts)=…`) → kills index use. Use a half-open range on the bare column.
- `COUNT(col)` when you meant `COUNT(*)` → `COUNT(col)` skips NULLs. Know which you want.
- `NOT IN (subquery)` with a NULL in the list → returns no rows. Prefer `NOT EXISTS`.

## Tailor to your environment
Record your setup in `references/your-environment.md` (keep anything sensitive — connection strings,
real table/column names, sample data — in `your-environment.private.md`, which is git-ignored). Note
your **SQL dialect** (Postgres, Snowflake, BigQuery, Oracle, SQL Server — they differ on `QUALIFY`,
date functions, and `LIMIT`/`FETCH`), your core tables and their grain, standard join keys, and any
naming or partitioning conventions. This skill then maps its generic steps onto your schema. If
your platform offers a governed reporting layer (like Oracle Fusion's OTBI subject areas), note here
when to prefer it over hand-written SQL.

**Keep your filled-in copy outside the plugin.** This file ships as a *template* and lives inside
the installed plugin, where a `/plugin marketplace update` can overwrite it or refuse to run against
a dirty tree. Copy it into your own project — `.claude/skills-env/sql-for-analysts.md` works well — fill it in
there, and point this skill at that copy. Your specifics then survive updates and stay somewhere you
own rather than in a cache you may not realise is disposable.
